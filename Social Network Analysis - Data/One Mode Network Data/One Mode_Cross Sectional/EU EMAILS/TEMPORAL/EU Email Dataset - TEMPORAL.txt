The network was generated using email data from a large European research institution. We have anonymized information about all incoming and outgoing email between members of the research institution. The e-mails only represent communication between institution members (the core), and the dataset does not contain incoming messages from or outgoing messages to the rest of the world. A directed edge (u, v, t) means that person u sent an e-mail to person v at time t. A separate edge is created for each recipient of the e-mail. We also have four sub-networks corresponding to the communication between members of four different departments at the institution. Node IDs in the sub-networks do not correspond to the same node ID in the entire network.

The static version of this network is the same as the largest weakly connected component of the email-Eu-core network (although the node IDs are not the same).
