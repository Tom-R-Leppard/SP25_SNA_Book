There are two basic ways that you can think about this. You may be interested in a specific group of people and how they relate to each other, or you may be interested in a specific person and find out who they are connected to.\n\n## Specific Subgraphs\n\nFirst, a subgraph to see a specific set of people and how/whether they are connected\n\nYou may have a list of individual nodes that you are interested in and you want to see how they related to each other. You can do this by creating a vector with the names of thise nodes, then use the subgraph function().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsub_people <- c('Wiley', 'Jammer', 'Flowdan', 'Ice Kid')\nsub_net <- subgraph(grime_08_clean, sub_people) \npar(mar = c(0,0,0,0))\nplot(sub_net)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Cleaning-Network-Data---Subgraphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ego Graphs\n\nNext, you may want to see ego networks from those in your network. In other words, smaller networks showing only the connections of each individual artist. To do this, you can use the make_ego_graph() argument. This creates a list of ego graphs from your entire network. Note, the order = 1 argument refers to the number of steps away from the ego (focal node). Since mine is set to 1, this only caputres the ego's immidiate neighbours (i.e. only those directly connected to ego).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nego_graphs <- make_ego_graph(grime_08_clean, order = 1)\nhead(ego_graphs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[[1]]\nIGRAPH ea1fb6d DN-- 2 1 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), collab_weight (e/n)\n+ edge from ea1fb6d (vertex names):\n[1] Asher D->Wiley\n\n[[2]]\nIGRAPH ea1fb81 DN-- 1 0 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), collab_weight (e/n)\n+ edges from ea1fb81 (vertex names):\n\n[[3]]\nIGRAPH ea1fb8a DN-- 1 0 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), collab_weight (e/n)\n+ edges from ea1fb8a (vertex names):\n\n[[4]]\nIGRAPH ea1fb93 DN-- 2 1 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), collab_weight (e/n)\n+ edge from ea1fb93 (vertex names):\n[1] Scorcher->Wiley\n\n[[5]]\nIGRAPH ea1fb9c DN-- 3 2 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), collab_weight (e/n)\n+ edges from ea1fb9c (vertex names):\n[1] Bless Beats->Wiley     Bless Beats->Roll Deep\n\n[[6]]\nIGRAPH ea1fba4 DN-- 3 2 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), collab_weight (e/n)\n+ edges from ea1fba4 (vertex names):\n[1] Flowdan->Wiley  Flowdan->Jammer\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also specify exactly which node's network you want to see. Let's say there was a person of interest in your network that you specifically want to see. To do this, you can do the folliwing using the node's name to single them out.\n\nThis chunk returns a lsit of edges connected to Wiley (the name of my node of interest).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nE(grime_08_clean)[[.inc('Wiley')]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n+ 8/28 edges from ea12474 (vertex names):\n             tail         head tid hid collab_weight\n1         Asher D        Wiley   1  29             1\n2        Scorcher        Wiley   4  29             4\n3     Bless Beats        Wiley   5  29             1\n4         Flowdan        Wiley   6  29             3\n5  Tinchy Stryder        Wiley   7  29             2\n6          Frisco        Wiley   8  29             1\n7            Kano        Wiley   9  29             1\n27          Wiley Lauren Mason  29  39             1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can also plot these. To do so, I make an object with the name 'Wiley' and then make an ego graph based on that name only. The \\[\\[1\\]\\] simply tells R to get only the first one in the list that make_ego_graph() creates. In this case, Wiley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nWiley <- \"Wiley\"\nego_wiley <- make_ego_graph(grime_08_clean, order = 1, nodes = Wiley)[[1]]\n\npar(mar = c(0,0,0,0))\nplot(ego_wiley)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Cleaning-Network-Data---Subgraphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also select an ego network with more information. The second order ego network includes the connections of Wiley's neighbours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsecond_order_wiley <- make_ego_graph(grime_08_clean, order = 2, nodes = Wiley)[[1]]\n\npar(mar = c(0,0,0,0))\nplot(second_order_wiley)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Cleaning-Network-Data---Subgraphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip: If you are working with ego networks like this, especially when you get passed the first order network (including friends of friends) it is good practice to do something to differentiate the ego from their neighbours. Once simple way it to change their colour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nV(second_order_wiley)$ego <- ifelse(V(second_order_wiley)$name %in% c(\"Wiley\"), \"red\", \"white\")\n\npar(mar = c(0,0,3,0))\nplot(second_order_wiley, vertex.color = V(second_order_wiley)$ego, main = \"Wiley's Second Order Ego Network\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Cleaning-Network-Data---Subgraphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, one other way to can subset a network is by a set parameter you may have. For example, you may want to see a network of frequent collaborators (more than 1 collab).\n\nThe following returns a vector with collaborators who work together more than once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfrequent_collabors <- E(grime_08_clean)[[collab_weight > 1]]\nfrequent_collabors\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n+ 8/28 edges from ea12474 (vertex names):\n             tail   head tid hid collab_weight\n2        Scorcher  Wiley   4  29             4\n4         Flowdan  Wiley   6  29             3\n5  Tinchy Stryder  Wiley   7  29             2\n8          Blacks Jammer  12  35             4\n9         Badness Jammer  13  35             5\n11        Tempa T Jammer  15  35             2\n14         Skepta Jammer  17  35             5\n16         Frisco Jammer   8  35             3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can then turn this vector of edges into a igraph object to plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfrequent_collabors_graph <- induced_subgraph(grime_08_clean, vids = unique(c(ends(grime_08_clean, frequent_collabors)[, 1], ends(grime_08_clean, frequent_collabors)[, 2])))\nplot(frequent_collabors_graph)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Cleaning-Network-Data---Subgraphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
