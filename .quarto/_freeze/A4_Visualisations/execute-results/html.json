Use the chunks (see below) to code in. Where you see ........................ please remove and write your response to the prompt.\n\nGrading: Full marks are awarded for completion. One mark will be dropped for each portion incomplete. This assignment will have 5 points per portion (4 questions/prompts to complete) and a total of 20 marks.\n\n\n## Place your library() here. You will need to list each one you will use!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Bringing in your data\n\nBy this time, you're a dab hand at bringing in your network data. Please bring in your network, convert it to a network object and view that object. Just a reminder, to view the network, just list the name of the network. If my igraph object (network object) is called 'graph' I can simply code graph in the chunk and I will view it.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean and or transform your network data if you need/want to and provide a raw (unaltered) visualisation using the plot() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Basic visualisation\nIn class, we have covered multiple basic visualizations. Using the markdown files and your notes from our class about basic network visualisation, I want you to demonstrate your skill in basic network visualisation.\n\nPlease alter the labels by either changing their size or toggling them.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the colours of the network (nodes or edges).\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent a basic visualisation, you feel appears clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss what alterations you have done to the network and why you did them. ..............................\n\n## Intermediate visualisation\nYou have learned how to tell a story through network visualisation. These stories centre prominent and influential nodes in the network.\n\nPresent a CLEAN network visual demonstrating popular (degree) nodes in your network.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent a CLEAN network visual demonstrating influential (betweenness) nodes in your network.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent them side-by-side sing the par() function. Consider presenting sub or main titles so I can tell which is which.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly (1 - 2 sentences) discuss the stories that your visualisations tell. E.g. who are/are they many or few popular/influential nodes? ..............................\n\n## Advanced visualisation\nYou have learned how to create interactive, or animated network visualisations.\n\nPlease produce one advanced network visualisation. Bare in mind that you will need to leave the visual as a widget in this markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly (1 - 2 sentences) discuss this visualisation. In what contexts may this visualisation be useful?\n\n# WELL DONE :)\n",
