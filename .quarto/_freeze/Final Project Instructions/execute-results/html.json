The aim of this project is for you to do an in-depth exploration which includes descriptions, visualisations, and some primary analysis. The learning outcomes for this is to demonstrate your skill in transforming (10 points), visualising (10 points) and analysing (20 points) network data.\n\nThe first two parts of the assignment, the transformation and visualisation of your data, are your exploration. Here, I want you to be paying attention to the nature of your data and how the network is structured. This should inform the last portion of the project - the analysis. Based on your exlporation, what types of questions are you asking about your data? What are some hypotheses you may have about people in the network or the network itself? You will need to write about these thoughts as part of your project to demonstrate your ability to explore network data and generate ideas on how to/what to analyse.\n\nThe \"rubric\" for this assignment is like all of our others - completion. Please fulfill all outlined prompts. Thus far, you have had assignments on exploring, transforming and visualising your network. Therefore, these components are worth only a small portion of the final marks of this assignment. Here is the breakdown:\n\nPart 1: Transforming (10 points) Part 2: Visualising (10 points) Part 3: Analysing (20 points) Total points = 40.\n\nAs usual, make a markdown document and submit is as a pdf.\n\nHere are some instructions for you to follow. Please refer to the \"final project example.html\" document on Moodle as an example final project for you to draw on for inspiration.\n\n## Example Layout and Instructions\n\n# FINAL PROJECT TITLE HERE\n\nFirst, open with a BRIEF paragraph discussing your project. Tell me what there data are and a little about what you are researching about the data. Here, you can imagine the types of questions your boss may have asked you to analyse on these data.\n\n## Part 1: Data Transformation\n\nIn this section you must bring in, clean and transform your network data.\n\nNOTE: If your network data are already clean you MUST transform the network some how. For example, create a subgraph, delete/add nodes/edges even if it does not make much sense. Just create a random object and do it. The point is you demonstrate the skill. \\## Part 2: Data Visualisation In this section, please produce at least one basic, intermediate, and advanced network visualisation. Beneath each one, please describe (1-2 sentences) the visualisation you have created discussing any observations you make about the network.\n\n## Part 3:\n\nHere, you must speculate on your explorations above. You have transformed and visualised your network data. What questions are you now going to ask about them? Based on your exploration, do you hypothesise certain things about the network or the people therein?\n\nIn this you must analyse and generate a report on your network. In your analysis, please discuss and present deliverables (tables, visualisations etc.) about the people in the network, the network itself, and communities within the network.\n\nBe creative about what analysis you would like to perform. You can combine skills here too. For example, visualise things as you analyse people/nodes in the networks. Or, you may identify a community of highly central people. You may then create a subgraph of a community you are interested in. Be creative!\n\nOne final note, remember that this is a report. You need to write this report as if I do not understand anything about networks, network data, or R. Be clear about what you are doing. Tie together how your exploration of the data led you to perform this analysis. For example, maybe the visualisations suggested that the network was very fragmented, or highly centralised. This may have led you to want to study certain people or perform certain analyses.\n\nFinal tips: When writing your markdown, use the following header guidelines: \\# Header \\## Subheader \\### Third-level header\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n",
